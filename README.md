Welcome to the INTRUSION-PREVENTION-SYSTEM-USING-ESP8266 wiki!

An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) using the ESP8266 is a lightweight security mechanism designed to detect and mitigate unauthorized or malicious activities in a Wi-Fi network. Leveraging the ESP8266's Wi-Fi capabilities and processing power, this system acts as a cost-effective solution for small-scale wireless network security.

Description: Core Functionality:

The ESP8266 operates in promiscuous mode to capture and analyze Wi-Fi packets. Identifies malicious activities such as rogue access points, MAC spoofing, or excessive network scanning. Uses signature-based detection (matching against predefined patterns) and/or anomaly detection (using thresholds or machine learning models). Detection Process:

Monitors data packets to identify unauthorized devices or abnormal traffic patterns. Flags suspicious activities such as deauthentication attacks or brute-force attempts. Prevention Mechanisms:

Sends real-time alerts to administrators via email, MQTT, or HTTP requests. Executes countermeasures, such as deauthenticating rogue devices or blocking them in the router's access control list. Applications:

Small office/home networks (SOHO). IoT device security. Educational projects on network security. Benefits: Low Cost: Affordable alternative to enterprise-grade IPS. Portability: Compact design and low power consumption. Scalability: Can integrate with existing systems for larger networks. This project is ideal for learning network security concepts and for deployment in environments requiring lightweight, budget-friendly protection.

An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) using ESP8266 is a security system designed to monitor, detect, and prevent unauthorized access or suspicious activities in a Wi-Fi network. The ESP8266 microcontroller, equipped with Wi-Fi capabilities, is commonly used for implementing lightweight and cost-effective solutions for such purposes. Here's a brief overview:

Features Packet Monitoring: ESP8266 can monitor Wi-Fi traffic to identify malicious patterns or unauthorized devices. Anomaly Detection: Uses predefined rules or machine learning models to flag unusual behavior. Active Prevention: Blocks unauthorized access by deauthenticating devices or restricting network access. Components ESP8266: Serves as the core processing unit for network monitoring and intrusion prevention. Sniffer Mode: Configured to capture network packets in promiscuous mode. Server/Controller: Optionally communicates with a backend for storing logs or updating rules. Implementation Steps Set up ESP8266:

Configure it in promiscuous mode to sniff packets. Use libraries like ESP8266WiFi for network handling. Packet Analysis:

Parse packets to extract details like MAC addresses and packet types. Compare with a whitelist of authorized devices. Intrusion Detection:

Identify unauthorized access points or devices. Detect anomalies using signature-based or anomaly-based detection methods. Prevention Mechanisms:

Send deauthentication frames to block malicious devices. Alert the user or log the event to a server. Additional Features:

Web-based or mobile interface for monitoring logs and managing rules. Integration with cloud services for advanced analytics. Use Cases Home Networks: Protect against unauthorized access. IoT Networks: Secure IoT devices connected via Wi-Fi. Small Offices: Provide basic intrusion prevention without expensive hardware. This project is suitable for research and practical applications, combining network security concepts with IoT hardware
